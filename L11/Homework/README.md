# Homework #JSVIII

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.

	* Recursion
		Answer: Recursion literally comes from the term, 'recur,' which means that an event has taken place once again. But in Coding, we make use of Recursion to invoke a function from within. A function is declared, but what if that function is only meant to deliver itself once again. Then the newly delivered function is set to deliver itself which is the third time for the root of the function. Setting aside literacy, in Code, it generates loops as well as the 'for' and 'while,' but the key difference is it invokes only and only itself. Notably, the same parts apply to writing Code for Recursion, but are used differently to present the whole function as recurring, but not truly repetitive.

2. From the top level of your `Precourse` folder, run `npm test L11/Homework/tests/JSVIII.test.js` to run the automated tests. You will fill out the functions in `homework.js` to make the tests pass.
