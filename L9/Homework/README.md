## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Callback Functions
		Answer: Callbacks are important in Coding as it lessens repetitive, yet necessary codings as we would call it. These are used to turn a function into an argument of another function. To put it in another way, we have created a function which contains an argument which we would then use in another function alongside a "cb" variable argument to set for callback. From the secondary function with the added "cb" variable argument, we would return it, and the "return cb(argument);" would generate an output of the secondary function combined with that of the first. Callbacks are used to integrate functions which are, can be, or may be related to each other for efficient Coding, therefore, efficient Programming.

2. From the top level of your `Precourse` folder, run `npm test L9/Homework/tests/JSVI.test.js` to run the automated tests. You will fill out the functions in `homework.js` to make the tests pass.
