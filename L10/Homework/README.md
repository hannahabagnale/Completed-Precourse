## Instructions

1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.

	* Closure
		Answer: Code wouldn't be really complete so as it call it "Code" without Closure. Closure is what ensures what we have entered in our Code Interfaces are enclosed and set up for programming or for launching in simple terms. It is required every creation of function in such a Code. It acts as a combination of functions bundled together all the while of allowing for any more functions to break through the program as a whole. Let's say we have created a function inside of a function. We enclose the function within the function to let the program acknowledge it as an independent function of the external function. We then take the external function as dependent on the independent one or on the one inside it. These codings are made possible by Closure, hence, it is essential.

2. From the top level of your `Precourse` folder, run `npm test L10/Homework/tests/JSVII.test.js` to run the automated tests. You will fill out the functions in `homework.js` to make the tests pass.
