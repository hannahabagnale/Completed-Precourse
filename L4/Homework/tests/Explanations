* Variables
		Answer: Variables act as objects in Code which have value. For example, you have an object or text which you would like to set as a variable in the program with the following Coding:
					var favouriteFood = 'Samgyeopsal';
		the program would then be informed that there exists the "favouriteFood" variable, and it would assume its value or output in any part of the Code where it is indicated would be "Samgyeopsal." To put it in other words, setting variables is important in Coding for the program to be much more simplified for as variables are set, its values are automatically linked to these.
	
	* Functions (arguments, `return`)
		Answer: Functions are used in Code to represent a group of statements' outputs 	in the program. Because it 	mainly represents grouped statements' outputs, it leads to much simplified coding as it could be reused in any other parts of the program, but would still perform the grouped statements' specific task. All in all, Functions may be compared to a variable, and its represented statements, its value, but it is collective, unlike variables which are individually coded. 
				
		In other cases, functions may have parameters which mean for specifications of the Functions' outputs or its values, known as "Arguments." In many ways, Arguments or the values of Functions may be used in the program. An Argument of a Function used as a Value refers to a Variable containing a specific Value in the Argument of the Function which would then serve as the output of the Function. On the other hand, Arguments used as Variables mean you do not have to specify such Values for these values are made constant in the whole Function.

		Return Statements of a Function are essential as they serve as the "Stop" signal to the Function. Once the Function has accomplished its output, the Return Statement would stop any more operations of the Function.

	* `if` statements
		Answer: In Code, "If" Statements are used to determine individual, specific outputs for individual, 				specific, or undefined Values of the set Variables. To put it in another way, in these statements
				is where you specify pre-determined Values of the Variables.
	
	* Boolean values (`true`, `false`)
		Answer: Boolean Values simply go by two values which are "True" and "False." In simple terms, these values 			only determine whether a variable is of "true," or "false."
