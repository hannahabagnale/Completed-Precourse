	* `prototype`
		Answer: Prototypes are referred to as Classes' method setting, and giving access to those methods to its every object. In other terms, prototypes let elements of an array access the object or objects associated with the array. For example, we are to generate a single introduction script for numerous elements of an array. With prototypes, every object would be involved in the same method, and would produce singled outcomes, individually.
	* Constructors
		Answer: Constructors are another term for Classes. Literally, Constructors would mean these are able to construct for whatever purposes, thus, better known as Classes in Code. Classes eliminate the need for repetitive Coding for specific designs as we intend as these may be expansive, but are exclusive. Classes pave the way for individual, yet similar outcomes of different elements as these group those together.
