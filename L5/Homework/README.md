1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* `for`
		Answer: The 'for' loop is used to essentially keep track of or to monitor the loop which is observed in its 		complex syntax. You are to indicate a variable, its conditional expression, and its increment in 			order to complete the said loop. For in a 'for' loop, the conditional statement is being evaluated, 		and if it renders 'true,' the loop would proceed to incrementing the variable. However, if the 				conditional statement has not been proven 'true' anymore, rather 'false,' the program would be put 			to a stop, and the 'for' loop would be back to zero or will restart.
	* `&&`, `||`, `!`
		Answer: The '&&' logic in words is referred to as "AND," meaning that both statements must be true in order 		for its return to be 'true' as well. If there are none or only one of the statements is true, the &&		logic operator would return 'false.' 
				The double vertical bar symbol '||' represents the "OR" logic operator in which one or both of the statements being true would be evaluated as 'true' as a whole. 
				Lastly, the "!" symbolizes the "NOT," simply known as the reverse of a statement wherein its return would be the exact opposite of the input.

2. From the top level of your `Precourse` folder, run `npm test L5/Homework/tests/JSII.test.js` to run the automated tests. You will fill out the functions in `homework.js` to make the tests pass.
