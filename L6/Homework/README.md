## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.

	* Arrays
		Answer: Arrays act as a storage unit where you can store multiple items at once in Code, thus, eliminating the need for individual assignments to singular variables. This then lessens the time usually consumed in order to assign variables and to input the necessary programming. With Arrays, variables still contain unique, varying values, but are seen as a collective for efficiency in programming. These may also be compared to a Set, containing numerous items, in a mathematical perspective, evident in our everyday lives.

2. 3. From the top level of your `Precourse` folder, run `npm test L6/Homework/tests/JSIII.test.js` to run the automated tests. You will fill out the functions in `homework.js` to make the tests pass.
